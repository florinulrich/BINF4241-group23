>> we decided to use an Interface Commandable instead of inheritance

- enter the corresponding number to access a device or execute a command, enter 0 to return
- the display is updating itself, i.e. when a timer ends, the display shows the option of starting (e.g. start washing) agian
- all inputs are covered by exceptions, i.e. only valid inputs will be considered
